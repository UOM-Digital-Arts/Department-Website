The creation of the world was driven by experimenting with Surrealist techniques on psychic automatism. These served as an exploration of the unconscious mind and lead me to explore the contradictions between public and self, conscious and unconscious. The animation was created by implementing and taking advantage of both 3D and 2D software/techniques, in order to facilitate and enhance the production workflow.",

Combining the digital and the traditional, each minimalistic and allusive illustration is carefully embroidered onto found fabric, culminating in an installation that ultimately aims to evoke personal memories, experiences, and emotions in every viewer.",

He has been working with MIXED MEDIA, graphic design, digital illustration and sculpting as a way to expand his artistic portfolio, and to gain a holistic approach to his creative process.

This dissertation is an exploration of the use of empty space and rhythm within 3-dimensional, immersive environments, and of how these elements affect the visualisation of an artwork in a virtual exhibition. Through the use of Minimalist design elements, 3D animation and sound design, 3 different virtual environments were created to illustrate the impact of space and movement in Virtual Reality.",

The shadow archetype can be defined as the parts of the self that are hidden and difficult to face, and are therefore generally avoided by the self. Virtual Reality is used as a medium to encourage confrontation with this part of the self in a space that is absolutely private and isolated.",

Through the exploration of 3D self-portraiture, this dissertation delves into the realm of interactivity and mixed reality. The utilisation of augmented reality technology creates a dynamic mixed-reality environment that captivates and enthralls the audience. This approach moves beyond the traditional mode of passive observation to active involvement, creating an immersive experience that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",

            "description": "The project revolves around Liam's reconciliation with himself as a creative, understanding himself and his expressions as an artist, through symbolic creations and experimentations. Liam looked to Carl Jung's personal reflections on the human psyche and the unconscious, salvaging his 'soul', in an attempt to produce a project hailing from Jung's work informing Liam's own reflections. Jung talks about the feminine aspect of the 'soul' present in men; the 'anima', which has connotations with being an underlying structure, the yin to the yang. Apart from the 'soul',  Liam's appeal to various art-making mediums are meant to portray an ordered-chaotic unconscious that is manoeuvred through, until the blossoming of an expressive dance ('soul').",

With a redesigned deck of cards inspired by the Maltese landscape, and a prototype mobile app that gamifies the archival of playing card games, Anthea aims to bridge the gap between traditional games and the community. Not only will you enhance your card-playing experience with L-Antika, but you'll also learn about how Maltese people spent their time in the past, while having fun in the present!",

Time is an aspect of the human condition that is often overlooked unless we are hassling over deadlines and appointments. This project is an attempt to acknowledge and showcase invisible moments in our daily lives as time goes by, via photography. The viewer is invited to meditate on the unconscious behaviours we display in such fleeting, negligible moments that are forgotten over the course of time, yet are an essential part of who we are.",

The intended message is communicated through photographs and objects collected from the ecological environment. By highlighting our connection to nature through the visual similarities, the three aforementioned human qualities are presented as natural and thus normal.",
