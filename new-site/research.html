                        <br>The Artists&rsquo; Film and Video Collection was originally collected by the Electronic and Digital Art Unit (EDAU) at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, UK and donated to the Department by Emeritus Professor
                        Chris Meigh-Andrews in 2000. It originally consisted of a large collection of artists' film and video on VHS, DVD and other tape media for viewing by researchers, undergraduate and post-graduate students interested in the field.
                        The Department of Digital Arts is currently digitising the works to make them available for research purposes.<br><br>The collection comprises over 1,700 historical and contemporary film and video works by more than 500 of the
                        most significant international artists working with the moving image.<br>

                        MaKS Immersion Laboratory

                    <p>
                        <br />The MaKS Immersion Laboratory is a mixed reality laboratory housing various Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Realty (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR/XR) technologies. The primary piece of technology is the SIntegraM Immersion CAVE,
                        a computer automated virtual environment allowing up to 3 people to stand in a 6-sided room with 3D position tracked visuals on each side. The laboratory also has several head-mounted virtual reality devices, such as the Oculus
                        Rift. One of the more exciting technology pieces is the Magic Leap, a dedicated Augmented Reality display allowing for holograph-like experiences and real-time interaction of the virtual with the real. The lab is used for various
                        projects, primarily SIntegraM, a project dedicated to 3D scanning and archiving all of Malta and Gozo using flying, land, sea and subterranean lidar and photogrammetry scanning tools. The laboratory offers ways to view and experience
                        this data. Other projects and researchers come from various departments to make use of our facilities including but not limited to the Departments of Digital Arts, Cognitive Sciences and Criminology. The technology can be used
                        for digital art installations, games, analysis of data such as crime scenes, conduct non-invasive studies, and experience otherwise dangerous scenarios in safe virtual settings.<br />

                        <br>The Immersion Lab University of Malta (ILUM) research project, based at MAKS, is supported through the EU SIntegraM project (ERDF.02.030). Throughout the ILUM research project, scientists collaborate on experimentation settings
                        into immersive experiences (IX) that enable visitors to actively engage with and learn about these topics and methods of investigation. ILUM has been awarded a Research Excellence Award, and is part of a European Commission, Erasmus+
                        Strategic Partnerships consortium for experiences in immersive technologies, 2021-2024. <br><br>

                    <p>
                        <br>ILUM forms part of an XR (extended reality) consortium, consisting of European Immersion Labs, namely the Immersion Lab of the Faculty of Media and Knowledge Sciences, University of Malta [ILUM], the Jagiellonian University,
                        Krakow, Poland [JU], the Visual Narratives Laboratory of Lodz Filmschool, Poland [VNLAB], the Immersive Lab at the Zurich University of the Arts, Switzerland [IL], the Department of Architecture, Design and Planning at University
                        of Sassari, Italy [DADU], and the Spatial Media Research Group at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece [SMRG].&nbsp;The strategic partnership aims at increasing the skills and competences of the participants
                        in designing and evaluating immersive experiences in order to effectively manage, disseminate, and produce culture in the digital sphere. Further, it is about increasing the knowledge and competences of the academic staff working
                        with immersion technologies, in order to effectively manage, disseminate, and produce digital culture in a market environment. The political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal aspect of the immersive trend
                        will be scrutinized through specialized training courses. The project&rsquo;s team will also elaborate open educational resources (OER) in the field of experience management and culture with the use of immersive technologies. Last
                        but not least, the projects aim is to help building an open attitude of students and academic staff towards the application of new technologies in the humanities.<br><br>

                        European Forum for Advanced Practices (EFAP)
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        <br>The Department of Digital Arts participates in the European Cooperation in Science &amp; Technology (COST) action the European Forum for Advanced Practices (EFAP). EFAP is an open and inclusive research network originating
                        from universities, NGOs and community-based organisations, independent research entities, museums, and a wide range of arts academies. EFAP&rsquo;s broad goal is to establish a dialog across the boundaries that often separate these
                        contexts and to promote exchange with a focus on emergent forms of artistic- and practice-based research. EFAP proposes an open notion of Advanced Practices that deliberately combine methods and practices from numerous disciplines.
                        The goal of EFAP is to respond to two sets of urgencies:<br><br>1) Ever-more complex societal challenges across Europe demand new forms of knowledge exchange and transfer, as new research forms gain ground and new modes of research
                        output become increasingly prominent.<br><br>2) This requires multidisciplinary and comprehensive methods to capture and assess their quality and impact in advance rather than retrospectively.<br>
